### Portable AppBundles! For everyone!
- They are portable because they use an Alpine ROOTFS to which the desired program has been added & they use `bwrap` in order to execute it. Not all of these use `bwrap`, but a large amount of them do
- All of these are multicall :)
- Other AppBundles here are simply AppImages based on Conty that are converted to the AppBundle format (thus getting rid of a lot of overhead)
- Other AppBundles may also be generated by pelfCreator but we get rid of their rootfs & container since they're not needed for a lot of purposes

##### W.I.P ; One of our objectives is to reach a thousand AppBundles per release. (HELP WANTED, CONTRIBUTIONS WELCOME, ADD YOUR FAVORITE PROGRAMs, HELP IMPROVE BUILD TIMES, ETC)
